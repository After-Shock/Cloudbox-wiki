In case you wanted to revoke the keys for some reason (eg switch to another domain name), here are the commands to do so. Run these as user (not sudo).

Note: This is not required if you are simply migrating Cloudbox to another server via [[backup and restore | Backup & Restore]] and use the same domain name (just remember update [[ domain name DNS settings | Prerequisites]]  if required).

1. Stop all containers:

   ```bash
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
   ```


1. Revoking keys for the domain:

   ```bash
   /opt/scripts/nginx/revoke_certs.sh
   ```

1. Before rerunning Cloudbox with your new settings (eg domain name change), it is advised to remove all the docker containers before hand. <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>


   ```bash
   docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
   ```



<sup><b id="f1">1</b> Cloudbox install will try to remove all the docker containers before installing, but it's still better to be safe by removing them manually before hand. If you need to keep other non-cloudbox containers, you may just remove the nginx container, instead, before rerunning Cloudbox. [â†©](#a1)</sup>
