You can use Cloudflare to setup a CDN with your Plex server. To see if this benefits your case scenario, try it out and compare the results. 

_Note: Only set this up once your Cloudbox is up and running; to make sure that domain DNS settings, nginx-proxy, SSL certificates are all working ok._

There are two ways to setup this up: 

- [[Via the cloudflared.py script|Cloudflare Script]] (recommended) 

- [[Manually|Cloudflare Manually]]
