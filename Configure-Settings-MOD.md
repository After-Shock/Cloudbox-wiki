|                   | `cron_time`           | How often to backup.                                                 | no       | `reboot`<br /> `yearly`<br /> `annually`<br /> `weekly`<br /> `daily`<br />  `hourly` | `weekly`                               | Only needed when `cron_state` is set to `present` <br />  <br /> Note 1: It is not recommended to schedule backups hourly as backing up may take a long time and cause future backup attempts to fail (the backup will not occur while another one is in progress, thanks to backup.lock file being created/removed during this process). <br /> Note 2: This option just allows the script to schedule the backup for you. You can manually schedule cron to run backups with `ansible-playbook cloudbox.yml --tags backup` called as root.                                                                                                 |
|                   | `cron_state`          | Option to enable/disable automatic backups.                          | yes      | `absent` <br /> `present`                                                             | `absent`                               | If set to `present`, you must specify `cron_time`. <br /> <br />  `absent` will remove any existing backup schedule. `present` will ensure it is always scheduled.               <br /> <br />   Note: When this option changed (whether to `present` or `absent`), a manual backup must be run once in order to set the backup schedule (i.e. `sudo ansible-playbook cloudbox.yml --tags backup`). In case the `absent` option is set, it will disable further backups after running the manual backup; however, you can manually remove the cron job (i.e. `sudo crontab -e`) if you did not want to run a manual backup command to do so. |
