# Adding a Subdomain

## Cloudflare:

If you are using CloudFlare as your domain's DNS provider, you will need to add the subdomain to your domain profile on their [[site|https://cloudflare.com]]. 

## Other Domain Hosting Sites:

### Default CB Install (aka Fullbox)

#### Allows Wildcards

You don't need to do anything. 

#### Doesnt Allow Wilcards

You will need to add the subdomain on your domain's DNS provider's website.  


### Feederbox/Plexbox: 

You will need to add the subdomain on your domain's DNS provider's website. 

Make sure you use the correct IP address (Feederbox or Plexbox).
